This project focused on the life and times of Sir Isaac Newton in Grantham
and South Kesteven, where he was born at Woolsthorpe Manor in 1643. Fascination
with Sir Isaac Newton spans the world. However while his scientific and 
mathematical writings are known in depth, some of the history about his life 
and his times in Lincolnshire lies unexplored in local archives and local places.
This project was born out of a desire by local people to dig deeper and discover 
those hidden stories. Supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.
