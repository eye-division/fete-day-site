The Greenham Cold War Experience is a unique opportunity to explore parts of Greenham Common that played a key role in the Cold War, through scenes presented by professional performers. &nbsp;

These special live events are timed to coincide with the public launch for the opening of Greenham Common Control Tower. Three 15-minute scenes with a Q & A with a local historian, will bring the Cold War of the 1980s to life, and two venues either side of the Common are linked by a 30 minute walk across the beautiful Greenham Common, a Site of Scientific Interest, and filled with wildlife amongst the relics of military life. (Total duration approx 90 to 100 mins).&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Decontamination Suite Tour &nbsp;**

Follow all instructions.&nbsp; DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LEAVE.&nbsp; Our theatrical guided tour will unveil the fascinating secrets locked away in Greenham’s chemical decontamination suite, part of the USAF Cold War former Wing Headquarters Building.

**Peace Camp Protests**

“Which side are you on, Which side are you on”.&nbsp; The protestors songs speak of the many different factions – the original protestors arriving from Wales, the new international visitors, the opposition of some locals to the peace camps, the military and Cold War situation across the globe…and the cruise missiles arriving at the Greenham base&nbsp;
