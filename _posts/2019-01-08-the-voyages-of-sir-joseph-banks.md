In 1768 Lincolnshire botanist Sir Joseph Banks funded his own trip on the HMS Endeavour voyage to Australia with Captain Cook. He took with him his own team of botanists and artists, and he went on to commission other botanists and explorers for later voyages.  He was a young man who had studied at Eton and Oxford and was still only 25 years of age when the HMS Endeavour sailed from Plymouth to discover chart the Transit of Venus in Tahiti and then to sail on to discover where the land mass of Terra Australis lay in the south Pacific ocean.

Banks was an enthusiast botanist and collector from a very early age, and before the Endeavour Voyage he had been part of an earlier voyage exploring Newfoundland.  After returning from Botany Bay and the Endeavour voyage he had hoped to go on a third voyage, again with Captain Cook, but he was refused permission so he funded his own voyage to Iceland.

On the return from his voyages Banks presented his findings at his home in Soho Square and held Banks' Breakfasts, in which discussion of his findings and those of other explorers and philosophers were central to the conversation.

Sir Joseph Banks grew up at Revesby Abbey in Lincolnshire. He spent his childhood in the Lincolnshire countryside and developed a passion for the study of plants. Lincolnshire at the time was one of Britain's wealthiest counties because of the wool trade
